# **Hospitalization Cost Prediction**

## **Defining the Problem**
Healthcare organizations struggle to forecast hospitalization costs due to the complexity of patient profiles, comorbidities, and variations in treatment requirements. This lack of accurate cost predictions can lead to:

- Budget overruns
- Inefficient resource utilization
- Under- or over-allocation of medical staff and supplies
- Patient stress due to unpredictable cost estimates

A 2019 study by the American Cancer Society found that **56% of adults reported at least one cost-related problem with their healthcare or health insurance**, such as delaying or skipping care due to costs. 

### **Why It Matters**
When healthcare costs are unpredictable or poorly managed, it impacts:
- **Organizations**: Challenges in financial planning, resource management, and maintaining patient care standards.
- **Patients**: Reduced affordability and accessibility to care, leading to delays or missed treatments.

## **Stakeholders Affected**
Key stakeholders include:

1. **Healthcare Administrators**: 
   - Use cost predictions for budgeting and resource allocation.
   - Ensure financial stability of the organization.

2. **Finance and Strategy Teams**:
   - Develop effective pricing strategies.
   - Set realistic financial targets.

3. **Medical Staff**:
   - Understand cost implications of treatment decisions.
   - Optimize patient care.

4. **Patients**:
   - Benefit from transparent cost estimates.
   - Plan healthcare expenses effectively.
   - Avoid delays or skipped care.

## **Root Cause Analysis**
Using the **Fishbone Diagram method**, we identify the reasons for the challenges in forecasting hospitalization costs:

### **1. Patient Factors**
- High variability in treatment needs and specialist consultations.
- Unpredictable treatment plans for patients with multiple diseases or illnesses.
- Age and demographics influencing care levels required.

### **2. Data & Analysis**
- Lack of access to adequate historical data.
- Inconsistent methods of data collection and interpretation across hospitals and departments.

### **3. Healthcare Processes**
- Variability in treatment approaches among medical staff.
- Lack of real-time cost tracking for patient care.
- Errors in data due to manual entry and outdated technology.

### **4. Variability in Patient Treatment**
- Differences in treatment based on location, physician preferences, or patient comfort levels.
- Unpredictable reactions to treatments affecting recovery time and hospital stay.
- Unexpected complications drastically altering costs.

### **5. Outside Factors**
- Insurance variations influencing cost predictions.
- Changes in healthcare laws or reimbursement policies impacting estimates.

### **6. Technology Challenges**
- Limited use of advanced machine learning models for predictions.
- Legacy systems incompatible with modern analytics tools.

## **Objective**
To develop a robust predicting model for hospitalization costs using advanced analytics and machine learning to address these challenges, benefiting both healthcare organizations and patients.
